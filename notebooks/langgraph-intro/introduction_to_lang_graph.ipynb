        "LangGraph is a tool that leverages LangChain Expression Language to build coordinated multi-actor and stateful applications that includes cyclic behaviour.\n",

        "### Why Cycles?\n",
        "\n",
        "In essence, we can think of a cycle in our graph as a more robust and customizable loop. It allows us to keep our application agent-forward while still giving the powerful functionality of traditional loops.\n",
        "\n",
        "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effectively allowing us to recreate application flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why LangGraph?\n",
        "\n",
        "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

QLoRA backpropagates gradients through\\na frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank\\nAdapters~(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all\\nprevious openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the\\nperformance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a\\nsingle GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without\\nsacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is\\ninformation theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double\\nquantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the\\nquantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We\\nuse QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of\\ninstruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets,\\nmultiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to\\nrun with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results\\nshow that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to\\nstate-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous\\nSoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human\\nand GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable\\nalternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot\\nbenchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of\\nchatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates where Guanaco fails compared to\\nChatGPT. We release all of our models and code, including CUDA kernels for\\n4-bit training.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-05-27\\nTitle: Accurate LoRA-Finetuning Quantization of LLMs via Information Retention\\nAuthors: Haotong Qin, Xudong Ma, Xingyu Zheng, Xiaoyang Li, Yang Zhang, Shouda Liu, Jie Luo, Xianglong Liu, Michele Magno\\nSummary: The LoRA-finetuning quantization of LLMs has been extensively studied to\\nobtain accurate yet compact LLMs for deployment on resource-constrained\\nhardware. However, existing methods cause the quantized LLM to severely degrade\\nand even fail to benefit from the finetuning of LoRA. This paper proposes a\\nnovel IR-QLoRA for pushing quantized LLMs with LoRA to be highly accurate\\nthrough information retention. The proposed IR-QLoRA mainly relies on two\\ntechnologies derived from the perspective of unified information: (1)\\nstatistics-based Information Calibration Quantization allows the quantized\\nparameters of LLM to retain original information accurately; (2)\\nfinetuning-based Information Elastic Connection makes LoRA utilizes elastic\\nrepresentation transformation with diverse information. Comprehensive\\nexperiments show that IR-QLoRA can significantly improve accuracy across LLaMA\\nand LLaMA2 families under 2-4 bit-widths, e.g., 4- bit LLaMA-7B achieves 1.4%\\nimprovement on MMLU compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The significant\\nperformance gain requires only a tiny 0.31% additional time consumption,\\nrevealing the satisfactory efficiency of our IR-QLoRA. We highlight that\\nIR-QLoRA enjoys excellent versatility, compatible with various frameworks\\n(e.g., NormalFloat and Integer quantization) and brings general accuracy gains.\\nThe code is available at https://github.com/htqin/ir-qlora.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-06-12\\nTitle: Exploring Fact Memorization and Style Imitation in LLMs Using QLoRA: An Experimental Study and Quality Assessment Methods\\nAuthors: Eugene Vyborov, Oleksiy Osypenko, Serge Sotnyk\\nSummary: There are various methods for adapting LLMs to different domains.

It is a technique used in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to improve the performance of language models by combining retrieval-based methods with generative models. Here’s a brief overview of how it works:\\n\\n1. **Retrieval**: In the first step, the system retrieves relevant documents or pieces of information from a large corpus or database. This is typically done using a retrieval model, such as BM25 or a dense retrieval model like DPR (Dense Passage Retrieval).\\n\\n2. **Augmentation**: The retrieved documents are then used to augment the input to the generative model. This means that the generative model has access to additional context or information that can help it produce more accurate and relevant responses.\\n\\n3. **Generation**: Finally, the generative model, such as GPT-3 or BERT, uses the augmented input to generate a response. The additional context provided by the retrieved documents helps the model generate more informed and contextually appropriate responses.\\n\\nRAG is particularly useful in scenarios where the generative model needs to produce responses based on a large and diverse set of information, such as in question-answering systems, chatbots, and other applications requiring detailed and accurate information retrieval.'"

Here are the key points regarding memory usage:\\n\\n1. **Memory Efficiency**: QLoRA reduces memory usage enough to fine-tune a 65 billion parameter model on a single 48GB GPU. This is achieved by backpropagating gradients through a frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank Adapters (LoRA).\\n\\n2. **Innovations for Memory Saving**:\\n   - **4-bit NormalFloat (NF4)**: A new data type that is optimal for normally distributed weights.\\n   - **Double Quantization**: Reduces the average memory footprint by quantizing the quantization constants.\\n   - **Paged Optimizers**: Manage memory spikes during training.\\n\\n3. **Comparison to Full Fine-Tuning**: Full fine-tuning typically requires significantly more memory because it involves updating all model parameters. In contrast, QLoRA updates only a small subset of parameters (the low-rank adapters) while keeping the rest of the model in a quantized, frozen state.\\n\\n4. **Performance**: Despite the reduced memory usage, QLoRA preserves the performance of full 16-bit fine-tuning tasks. For example, the Guanaco model family, fine-tuned using QLoRA, outperforms previous openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, achieving 99.3% of the performance level of ChatGPT.\\n\\nIn summary, QLoRA offers a substantial reduction in memory usage compared to full fine-tuning, making it feasible to fine-tune very large models on hardware with limited memory without sacrificing performance.',\n",

This is crucial for ensuring that the fine-tuned models perform well on their intended tasks.\\n\\n3. **Double Quantization**: NF4 is part of a broader strategy in QLoRA that includes double quantization, which further reduces the average memory footprint by quantizing the quantization constants themselves.\\n\\n4. **Paged Optimizers**: Alongside NF4, QLoRA introduces paged optimizers to manage memory spikes, ensuring that the memory usage remains efficient throughout the fine-tuning process.\\n\\n5. **Broad Applicability**: The use of NF4 in QLoRA has been demonstrated across various model types (e.g., LLaMA, T5) and scales (e.g., 33B and 65B parameter models), showing its versatility and effectiveness in different contexts.\\n\\n6. **State-of-the-Art Results**: Fine-tuning with QLoRA and NF4 on small, high-quality datasets has led to state-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models compared to previous state-of-the-art approaches.\\n\\nIn summary, the 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4) data type is a critical innovation in QLoRA that enables efficient and effective fine-tuning of large language models by optimizing memory usage while preserving performance.',\n",

It allows fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) on resource-constrained hardware by using a combination of 4-bit quantization and Low-Rank Adapters (LoRA).\\n- **Key Innovations**:\\n  - **4-bit NormalFloat (NF4)**: A new data type optimized for normally distributed weights.\\n  - **Double Quantization**: Reduces memory footprint by quantizing the quantization constants.\\n  - **Paged Optimizers**: Manages memory spikes during training.\\n- **Performance**: QLoRA has been shown to achieve state-of-the-art results with significantly reduced computational resources. For example, it can fine-tune a 65B parameter model on a single 48GB GPU.\\n\\n**PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning)**:\\n- **Definition**: PEFT techniques aim to fine-tune large pre-trained models by adding a small number of trainable parameters while keeping the majority of the pre-trained parameters fixed. This approach addresses issues of overfitting and high computational costs associated with fully fine-tuning large models.\\n- **Common Methods**:\\n  - **Low-Rank Adapters (LoRA)**: Adds low-rank matrices to the model's layers, which are the only parameters updated during fine-tuning.\\n  - **Other Techniques**: Include methods like prompt tuning, adapter tuning, and more, which also focus on updating a small subset of parameters.\\n\\n**Relationship**:\\n- **Integration**: QLoRA is a specific implementation of PEFT. It combines the principles of PEFT with quantization techniques to further reduce memory usage and computational requirements.\\n- **Efficiency**: Both QLoRA and PEFT aim to make the fine-tuning of large models more efficient. QLoRA extends the concept of PEFT by incorporating quantization, which allows for even more significant reductions in resource usage.\\n- **Performance**: QLoRA demonstrates that PEFT methods can achieve high performance even with substantial reductions in the number of trainable parameters and memory usage.\\n\\nIn summary, QLoRA can be seen as an advanced form of PEFT that leverages quantization to enhance the efficiency and feasibility of fine-tuning large language models on limited hardware.\",\n",

This paradigm presents challenges for\\nsystems that serve real-time responses to queries that each involve a different\\nLoRA. Prior works optimize the design of such systems but still require\\ncontinuous loading and offloading of LoRAs, as it is infeasible to store\\nthousands of LoRAs in GPU memory. To mitigate this issue, we investigate the\\nefficacy of compression when serving LoRA adapters. We consider compressing\\nadapters individually via SVD and propose a method for joint compression of\\nLoRAs into a shared basis paired with LoRA-specific scaling matrices. Our\\nexperiments with up to 500 LoRAs demonstrate that compressed LoRAs preserve\\nperformance while offering major throughput gains in realistic serving\\nscenarios with over a thousand LoRAs, maintaining 75% of the throughput of\\nserving a single LoRA.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-04-07\\nTitle: A Note on LoRA\\nAuthors: Vlad Fomenko, Han Yu, Jongho Lee, Stanley Hsieh, Weizhu Chen\\nSummary: LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) has emerged as a preferred method for efficiently\\nadapting Large Language Models (LLMs) with remarkable simplicity and efficacy.\\nThis note extends the original LoRA paper by offering new perspectives that\\nwere not initially discussed and presents a series of insights for deploying\\nLoRA at scale.

However, it still faces resource consumption challenges\\nduring training when scaling up to larger models. Most previous studies have\\ntackled this issue by using pruning techniques, which involve removing LoRA\\nparameters deemed unimportant. Nonetheless, these efforts only analyze LoRA\\nparameter features to evaluate their importance, such as parameter count, size,\\nand gradient. In fact, the output of LoRA (product of LoRA parameter and hidden\\nstate), directly impacts the final results. Preliminary experiments indicate\\nthat a fraction of LoRA elements possesses significantly high output values,\\nsubstantially influencing the layer output. Motivated by the observation, we\\npropose LoRA-drop. Concretely, LoRA-drop evaluates the importance of LoRA based\\non the LoRA output. Then we retain LoRA for important layers and the other\\nlayers share the same LoRA. We conduct abundant experiments with models of\\ndifferent scales on NLU and NLG tasks. Results demonstrate that LoRA-drop can\\nachieve performance comparable to full fine-tuning and LoRA, while retaining\\n50\\\\% of the LoRA parameters on average.\",\n",

However, their general ability to improve\\nthe performance of physiological signal deep learning model is immature. In\\nthis study, we experimentally analyze four attention mechanisms (e.g.,\\nsqueeze-and-excitation, non-local, convolutional block attention module, and\\nmulti-head self-attention) and three convolutional neural network (CNN)\\narchitectures (e.g., VGG, ResNet, and Inception) for two representative\\nphysiological signal prediction tasks: the classification for predicting\\nhypotension and the regression for predicting cardiac output (CO). We evaluated\\nmultiple combinations for performance and convergence of physiological signal\\ndeep learning model. Accordingly, the CNN models with the spatial attention\\nmechanism showed the best performance in the classification problem, whereas\\nthe channel attention mechanism achieved the lowest error in the regression\\nproblem. Moreover, the performance and convergence of the CNN models with\\nattention mechanisms were better than stand-alone self-attention models in both\\nproblems. Hence, we verified that convolutional operation and attention\\nmechanisms are complementary and provide faster convergence time, despite the\\nstand-alone self-attention models requiring fewer parameters.\\n\\nPublished: 2018-10-17\\nTitle: An Analysis of Attention Mechanisms: The Case of Word Sense Disambiguation in Neural Machine Translation\\nAuthors: Gongbo Tang, Rico Sennrich, Joakim Nivre\\nSummary: Recent work has shown that the encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in neural\\nmachine translation (NMT) are different from the word alignment in statistical\\nmachine translation. In this paper, we focus on analyzing encoder-decoder\\nattention mechanisms, in the case of word sense disambiguation (WSD) in NMT\\nmodels. We hypothesize that attention mechanisms pay more attention to context\\ntokens when translating ambiguous words. We explore the attention distribution\\npatterns when translating ambiguous nouns. Counter-intuitively, we find that\\nattention mechanisms are likely to distribute more attention to the ambiguous\\nnoun itself rather than context tokens, in comparison to other nouns. We\\nconclude that attention mechanism is not the main mechanism used by NMT models\\nto incorporate contextual information for WSD. The experimental results suggest\\nthat NMT models learn to encode contextual information necessary for WSD in the\\nencoder hidden states. For the attention mechanism in Transformer models, we\\nreveal that the first few layers gradually learn to \\\"align\\\" source and target\\ntokens and the last few layers learn to extract features from the related but\\nunaligned context tokens.\",\n",
