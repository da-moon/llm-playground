Extensive studies have been proposed to\\r\\nextend the context window and achieve length extrapolation of LLMs, but there is\\r\\nstill a lack of in-depth interpretation of these approaches. In this study, we explore\\r\\nthe positional information within and beyond the context window for deciphering\\r\\nthe underlying mechanism of LLMs. By using a mean-based decomposition\\r\\nmethod, we disentangle positional vectors from hidden states of LLMs and analyze\\r\\ntheir formation and effect on attention. Furthermore, when texts exceed the context\\r\\nwindow, we analyze the change of positional vectors in two settings, i.e., direct\\r\\nextrapolation and context window extension. Based on our findings, we design two\\r\\ntraining-free context window extension methods, positional vector replacement\\r\\nand attention window extension. Experimental results show that our methods can\\r\\neffectively extend the context window length.\\r\\n1 Introduction\\r\\nRecently, Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated excellent capabilities\\r\\non downstream tasks [1–3], in which positional encodings (e.g., absolute or relative) are widely used\\r\\nin Transformers to better capture positional information within input sequences [4, 5]. However,\\r\\nLLMs typically suffer from a limited input length (called context window), which is constrained by\\r\\nthe maximum length of training data. Beyond the context window, the positional encodings at larger\\r\\nposition indices are out-of-distribution (OOD), not encountered during the training phase. Therefore,\\r\\nwhen the input sequence exceeds the context window length, there would often be a significant\\r\\ndegradation in model performances, as evidenced by a surge in perplexity (PPL) score [6].\\r\\nPrior work has primarily focused on extending the context window of existing LLMs by manipulating\\r\\npositional encodings. Owing to its excellent performance and long-term decay nature, RoPE [7] has\\r\\nbeen widely used to learn positional encodings for existing LLMs [8, 9]. To circumvent the OOD\\r\\npositional encodings in RoPE, various methods have been proposed to modify the base [10–12] or\\r\\npositional indices [13–16]. In addition, special relative positional encodings that apply larger negative\\r\\nbiases to attention based on the relative distance have achieved promising length extrapolation, which\\r\\n∗Equal Contribution.\\r\\n†Corresponding author.\\r\\nPreprint.

(AP Photo/Christophe Ena)\\nPARIS (AP) \\u2014 Novak Djokovic made clear for years this was his goal. What drove him. What inspired him. The biggest titles from his sport\\u2019s biggest stages were Djokovic\\u2019s main aim and now he finally stands alone \\u2014 ahead of Rafael Nadal, ahead of Roger Federer, ahead of every man who ever has swung a racket.\\nIf Djokovic could wait this long to hold this record, he certainly could wait for the half-hour or so it took to straighten out his strokes in the French Open final. And so, after a bit of a shaky start in thick, humid air and under foreboding clouds Sunday, he imposed himself. The opponent at Court Philippe Chatrier, Casper Ruud, never really stood a serious chance after that.\\nDjokovic earned his men\\u2019s-record 23rd Grand Slam singles championship, breaking a tie with Nadal and moving three in front of the retired Federer, with a 7-6 (1), 6-3, 7-5 victory over Ruud that was not in doubt for most of its 3 hours, 13 minutes.\\nDjokovic puts this one alongside the French Open titles he earned in 2016 and 2021, making him the only man with at least three from each major. He won his very first at the 2008 Australian Open and now possesses a total of 10 trophies from there, seven from Wimbledon and three from the U.S. Open.\\n\\u201cI knew that going into the tournament, going into the match, especially, today, that there is history on the line, but I try to focus my attention and my thoughts into preparing for this match in the best way possible to win, like any other match,\\u201d Djokovic said, wearing a red jacket with \\u201c23\\u201d stitched on the chest. \\u201cOf course I would lie if I say that I didn\\u2019t think about the finish line that is right there and that one more match is needed to win a trophy \\u2014 a historic one.\\u201d\\nAlso worth noting: He again is halfway to a calendar-year Grand Slam \\u2014 winning all four majors in one season \\u2014 something no man has achieved since Rod Laver in 1969. Djokovic came close in 2021, when he won the Australian Open, French Open and Wimbledon and made it all the way to the title match at the U.S. Open before losing to Daniil Medvedev.\\nDjokovic will resume that pursuit at Wimbledon, which begins on the grass of the All England Club on July 3.\\n\\u201cHe has this software in his head that he can switch (on) when a Grand Slam comes,\\u201d said his coach, Goran Ivanisevic. \\u201cThe day we arrived here, he was better, he was more motivated, he was more hungry. Every day, he played better and better.\\u201d\\nEntering the 2011 season, this is how the Slam count looked: 16 for Federer, nine for Nadal, one for Djokovic.\\n\\u201cPretty decent 12 years, I must say, for me,\\u201d Djokovic said with a smile.\\nThe climb began with a trio that year and accelerated lately: He has clutched the trophy at 11 of the last 20 Slams, a remarkable run made even more so when considering that he did not participate in two majors during that span because he did not get vaccinated against COVID-19. Djokovic was deported in January 2021 before the Australian Open, and he was not allowed to fly to the United States ahead of last year\\u2019s U.S. Open under a rule that since has been lifted.\\nGetting to 23 not only sets the mark for men, but it also lets Djokovic equal Serena Williams, who wrapped up her career last year, for the most by anyone in the Open era, which began in 1968. Margaret Court won some of her all-time record of 24 Slam trophies in the amateur era.\\nAt 20 days past his 36th birthday, the Serb is the oldest singles champion at Roland Garros, considered the most grueling of the majors because of the lengthy, grinding points required by the red clay, which is slower than the grass or hard courts underfoot elsewhere.\\nNadal\\u2019s 22nd major arrived in Paris a year ago, two days after he turned 36. He has been sidelined since January by a hip injury and had arthroscopic surgery on June 2.\\n\\u201cMany congrats on this amazing achievement,\\u201d Nadal tweeted shortly after the final concluded. \\u201c23 is a number that just a few years back was (impossible) to think about, and you made it!\\u201d\\nDjokovic\\u2019s triumph on Sunday means he will return to No. 1 in the ATP rankings on Monday, replacing Carlos Alcaraz. Djokovic already has spent more weeks at the top spot than any player \\u2014 man or woman \\u2014 since the inception of computerized tennis rankings a half-century ago.\\nIt was Djokovic who eliminated Alcaraz in the semifinals on Thursday, wearing him down over two thrilling sets until the 20-year-old Spaniard\\u2019s body cramped up badly. Alcaraz continued to play, but the scores of the last two sets of the four-set match told the story: 6-1, 6-1.\\nThis was the third Slam final in the past five events for Ruud, a 24-year-old from Norway, but he is now 0-3. He lost to Nadal at the French Open a year ago and to Alcaraz at the U.S. Open last September.\\nPerhaps due to an awareness of all that was at stake, Djokovic, in his 34th major final, was the one who got off to a shaky start.\\n\\u201cMaybe feeling a bit nervous, little stressed,\\u201d Ruud said about his opponent.\\nBut by the close of the first set, Djokovic was downright Djokovic-esque, as he was while taking 12 of the last 13 points of the match, most accompanied by spectators\\u2019 thunderous chants of his two-syllable nickname, \\u201cNo-le! No-le! No-le!\\u201d\\nWhen one last miscue from Ruud landed out, Djokovic dropped onto his back with limbs spread wide.\\n\\u201cHe kind of pressures you, in a way, to go for more risks, and that\\u2019s tough,\\u201d Ruud said. \\u201cHe just stepped up, like he knows how to do.\\u201d\\nAt first, though, Djokovic kept missing forehands \\u2014 into the net, wide, long \\u2014 then made a different sort of mistake, shanking an overhead from near the net way beyond the opposite baseline to get broken and trail 2-0.\\nFor whatever reason, that shot always has been Djokovic\\u2019s \\u201cb\\u00eate noire,\\u201d and he missed another overhead later in the set.\\nSoon, Ruud led 4-1, thanks in part to Djokovic\\u2019s troubles. By then, Djokovic accumulated 13 unforced errors, while Ruud made just four.\\nAnd then everything changed.\\nAfter finishing the first set with 18 unforced errors, Djokovic recalibrated himself, with merely 14 over the last two sets combined.\\nThen it was Ruud\\u2019s turn to flub an overhead, rocking back and depositing his into the net to end a 29-stroke point. Djokovic\\u2019s first service break made it 4-3, and he shook his right fist.\\n\\u201cA bit devastating,\\u201d Ruud called it.\\nThey went to a tiebreaker, truly Djokovic\\u2019s dominion. When the import rises, along with the tension, he simply excels.\\n\\u201cHe sort of just goes into this mode,\\u201d Ruud said, \\u201cwhere he just becomes like a wall.\\u201d\\nDuring the first-to-7 segment, Djokovic contributed four winners and zero unforced errors.\\nThat made his career mark in tiebreakers 308-162, a winning percentage of .655. In 2023, he is 15-4, including 6-0 in Paris \\u2014 there were 55 points played across that half-dozen, and Djokovic\\u2019s sum total of unforced errors was zero.\\n\\u201cHe just steps up,\\u201d Ruud said. \\u201cEither he plays ridiculous defense or he plays beautiful winners. Just doesn\\u2019t do any mistakes.\\u201d\\nThat set alone lasted 1 hour, 21 minutes, chock full of extended exchanges, the sort of points about which entire stories could be written. There were those that lasted 20, 25, 29 strokes. One was won by Ruud with the help of a back-to-the-net, between-the-legs shot. On another, Djokovic tumbled behind the baseline, smudging his red shirt, blue shorts and skin with the rust-colored clay.\\nDjokovic\\u2019s scrambling and stretching and bending and twisting on defense shows up on the scoreboard, for sure. But all of the long points also sap an opponent\\u2019s energy and will.\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s just annoying for me,\\u201d Ruud said, \\u201cbut it\\u2019s very, very impressive.\\u201d\\nWhen Djokovic broke to lead 3-0 in the second set, his powers now on full display, he jabbed his right index finger against his temple over and over and over. He wheeled to face his nearby box in the stands, where the group included Ivanisevic, Djokovic\\u2019s wife and two children, his parents, his agent and even seven-time Super Bowl champion Tom Brady.\\nThe retired Brady is widely viewed as the NFL\\u2019s \\u201cGreatest Of All Time\\u201d \\u2014 or \\u201cGOAT,\\u201d for short \\u2014 and there has been a debate in the tennis world for quite some time over which among Djokovic, Nadal or Federer deserves that sobriquet.\\nIf the barometer is Grand Slam championships, no one can argue against Djokovic\\u2019s status at the moment.\\n\\u201cI leave those kind of discussions of \\u2018who is the greatest?\\u2019 to someone else. I have, of course, huge faith and confidence and belief (in) myself and for everything that I am and who I am and what I am capable of doing,\\u201d Djokovic said at his news conference, the Coupes des Mousquetaires at arm\\u2019s length. \\u201cSo this trophy obviously is another confirmation of the quality of tennis that I\\u2019m still able to produce, I feel.\\u201d\\n___\\nAP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\\nCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

You already achieved so much \\u2014 and you\\u2019re only 21 years old,\\u201d said Zverev, who also lost the 2020 U.S. Open final, that one after being two points from winning. \\u201cIncredible player. Not the last time you\\u2019re going to win this.\\u201d\\nZverev, a 27-year-old from Germany, exited the French Open in the semifinals each of the past three years, including after tearing ankle ligaments during the second set against Nadal in that round in 2022. Hours before Zverev\\u2019s semifinal victory over Casper Ruud began on Friday, a Berlin district court announced that he reached an out-of-court settlement that ended a trial stemming from an ex-girlfriend\\u2019s accusation of assault during a 2020 argument.\\nSports\\nThe Spanish tennis pipeline that's produced Carlos Alcaraz and Rafael Nadal\\nOn Sunday against Alcaraz, Zverev faltered after surging in front by reeling off the last five games of the third set. Alcaraz\\u2019s level dipped during that stretch and he seemed distracted by a complaint over the condition of the clay, telling chair umpire Renaud Lichtenstein it was \\u201cunbelievable.\\u201d\\nBut Alcaraz reset and ran away with it, taking 12 of the last 15 games while being treated by a trainer at changeovers for some pain and cramping in his left leg.\\n\\u201cI know that when I\\u2019m playing a fifth set, you have to give everything and you have to give your heart,\\u201d Alcaraz said. \\u201cI mean, in those moments, it\\u2019s where the top players give their best tennis.\\u201d\\nNo. 3 seed Alcaraz and No. 4 Zverev were making their first appearance in a French Open final. Indeed, this was the first men\\u2019s title match at Roland Garros since 2004 without at least one of Nadal, Novak Djokovic or Roger Federer.\\nNadal, who is 38 and was limited by injuries over the last two seasons, lost to Zverev in the first round two weeks ago; Djokovic, 37, a three-time champion, withdrew before the quarterfinals with a knee injury that required surgery; Federer, 42, is retired.\\nThere were some jitters at the outset. Zverev started with two double-faults \\u2014 changing rackets after the second, as though the equipment were the culprit \\u2014 and got broken. Alcaraz lost serve immediately, too.\\nLet\\u2019s just say they won\\u2019t be putting those initial 10 minutes in the Louvre. Actually, lot of the 4-hour, 19-minute match was patchy, littered with unforced errors.\\nAlcaraz was at his best when it mattered the most \\u2014 the last two sets.\\n\\u201cI lost focus, and on my serve, I didn\\u2019t get the power from my legs anymore, which is weird. Because normally I do not get tired. I don\\u2019t cramp,\\u201d Zverev said. \\u201cAgainst Carlos, it\\u2019s a different intensity.\\u201d\\nJust like he did against Zverev, Alcaraz overturned a deficit of two sets to one against Sinner, making him the first man to capture the French Open by doing that in each of the last two matches since Manolo Santana \\u2014 also from Spain \\u2014 in 1961.\\nAlcaraz showed off all of his skills: the drop shots, the artful half-volleys, the intimidating forehands delivered aggressively and accompanied by a loud grunt. His 27 forehand winners were 20 more than Zverev\\u2019s total.\\nNot bad for a guy who arrived in Paris saying he was afraid to hit his forehand at full force because of a forearm injury that sidelined him for nearly all of May. He said Sunday that there were \\u201ca lot of doubts\\u201d entering the French Open and he was forced to limit his practice time \\u2014 which is why he considers this victory the proudest moment of his still-nascent career.\\nIn the fifth set, under constant pressure from Alcaraz, Zverev got broken to fall behind 2-1. The next game showed the grit and gumption that already are hallmarks of Alcaraz\\u2019s style.\\nZverev \\u2014 who argued about one line call on a second serve by Alcaraz that the German said afterward was out according to an unofficial video review \\u2014 would hold four break points. He failed to convert any. Alcaraz didn\\u2019t let him, and wrapped up the game with a drop shot.\\nThe crowd roared. Alcaraz held his left index finger to his ear while waving his racket. He broke again for 5-2, then served it out and dropped onto his back, caking his shirt with clay \\u2014 just as Nadal often did after championship point.\\nAlcaraz first learned to play tennis on the rust-colored surface, although he says he prefers hard courts. Alcaraz says he dreamed long ago of adding his own name to the list of Spanish men to win the event, including his coach, 2003 champion Juan Carlos Ferrero.\\nAnd those red-and-yellow Spanish flags that became such an annual fixture at Court Philippe Chatrier in the era of Nadal were there again Sunday, this time for Alcaraz. The difference? The cries of \\u201cRa-fa! Ra-fa!\\u201d were now \\u201cCar-los! Car-los!\\u201d\\nSponsor Message\\nBecome an NPR sponsor\"}], \"response_time\": 4.07}, \"status\": \"success\"}\n",

        "\n",
        "the following are tasks that require significant reasoning capability:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Complex Task Coordination:\n",
        "The LLM needs to coordinate between multiple agents (Search, PaperInformationRetriever, and Supervisor) and understand their roles and capabilities. This requires a high level of reasoning to decide which agent should act next based on the current state and goal.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Information Synthesis:\n",
        "The LLM must synthesize information from multiple sources (search results and paper-specific information) to form coherent and relevant responses. This involves understanding context, relevance, and how different pieces of information relate to each other.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Task Decomposition:\n",
        "Breaking down complex research queries into subtasks that can be handled by different agents requires sophisticated reasoning. The LLM needs to understand the overall goal and how to efficiently divide the work.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Natural Language Understanding:\n",
        "The LLM must interpret user queries, which can be complex and nuanced, especially when dealing with technical topics like AI research papers.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Contextual Decision Making:\n",
        "Deciding when to switch between agents or when to conclude the research process (FINISH) requires understanding the current state of knowledge and the quality of information gathered so far.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Handling Ambiguity:\n",
        "Research questions often involve ambiguity. A powerful LLM is needed to navigate unclear aspects of queries and decide how to proceed when information is incomplete or contradictory.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Specialized Knowledge Application:\n",
        "Understanding and working with technical AI concepts mentioned in the paper requires a model with broad and deep knowledge in the field.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. Output Quality and Coherence:\n",
        "Generating high-quality, coherent responses that accurately reflect the research findings and meet the user's needs requires advanced language generation capabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. Error Handling and Recovery:\n",
        "The ability to recognize when an approach isn't working and to adjust the strategy accordingly requires sophisticated reasoning.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. Instruction Following with Flexibility:\n",
        "The LLM needs to follow the given instructions (like using specific tools) while also being flexible enough to handle unexpected scenarios or information.\n",
        "\n",
        "These tasks require a high degree of reasoning, context understanding, and knowledge application, which are characteristics of more powerful LLMs. A less capable model might struggle with these complex cognitive tasks, potentially leading to less accurate research outcomes, poor task allocation, or inability to effectively synthesize information from multiple sources."

This was achieved using a method called QLoRA fine-tuning.\\n\\n2. **Efficiency of Training**: The training process was highly efficient, taking only 8 hours on a single machine equipped with 8xA800 (80G) GPUs.\\n\\n3. **Use of Synthetic Training Data**: The dramatic increase in context length was facilitated by the use of 3,500 synthetic training samples, which were generated by a more powerful language model, GPT-4.\\n\\n4. **Improved Model Performance**: The resulting model demonstrated superior performance across a broad range of evaluation tasks, indicating that the extended context length significantly enhanced its capabilities.\\n\\n5. **Potential for Scalability**: The results highlight the potential for large language models to handle longer contexts effectively, provided additional computational resources are available.\\n\\nThis advancement suggests significant implications for the development of language models, especially in terms of processing and understanding larger blocks of text efficiently.\",\n",

        "#### 🔍Answer #2:\n",
        "\n",
        "Given that we're already using a supervisor agent, there are indeed several ways\n",
        "to ensure specific tool usage and set a concrete flow through tools within this\n",
        "framework. Here are some strategies:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Tool Assignment to Specific Agents:\n",
        "   When creating worker agents, you can explicitly assign specific tools to each agent. For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   research_agent = create_agent(llm, [tavily_tool], \"You are a web researcher.\")\n",
        "   code_agent = create_agent(llm, [python_repl_tool], \"You are a coder.\")\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   This ensures that each agent only has access to the tools you want it to use.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Supervisor Logic:\n",
        "   You can modify the supervisor's decision-making logic to route tasks to specific agents based on the required tools. For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   def supervisor_logic(state):\n",
        "       if \"search\" in state[\"input\"].lower():\n",
        "           return \"Researcher\"\n",
        "       elif \"code\" in state[\"input\"].lower():\n",
        "           return \"Coder\"\n",
        "       else:\n",
        "           return \"FINISH\"\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Conditional Edges:\n",
        "   In the graph construction, you can use conditional edges to enforce a specific flow:\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   workflow.add_conditional_edges(\n",
        "       \"supervisor\",\n",
        "       supervisor_logic,\n",
        "       {\n",
        "           \"Researcher\": \"Researcher\",\n",
        "           \"Coder\": \"Coder\",\n",
        "           \"FINISH\": END\n",
        "       }\n",
        "   )\n",
        "   ```\n",
